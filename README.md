Macroeconomic Regression Workflow Using Python
Overview
This repository implements a reproducible Python workflow for retrieving monthly US macroeconomic data from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), preparing the series, estimating a baseline regression, running diagnostic checks, and exporting tables and figures in a reviewer-friendly structure.

The project is intended as a compact empirical workflow and coding sample. Its regression estimates describe conditional associations and should not be interpreted as causal effects.

Research Question
How are short-term monetary policy conditions and labor-market slack associated with movements in US industrial production?

Data
The scripts download three monthly series directly from FRED:

FRED code	Variable	Units
INDPRO	Industrial Production: Total Index	Index, 2017 = 100; seasonally adjusted
FEDFUNDS	Effective Federal Funds Rate	Percent; not seasonally adjusted
UNRATE	Civilian Unemployment Rate	Percent; seasonally adjusted
The sample begins on 1990-01-01 and ends at the latest observation available when the workflow is run. Raw data are not committed because they are retrieved programmatically. See data/README.md for series definitions, processing steps, and the reproducibility caveat.

Baseline Specification
The descriptive baseline model is:

INDPRO ~ FEDFUNDS + UNRATE
The workflow performs:

date alignment, numeric conversion, missing-value removal, and validation;
ordinary least squares estimation;
HC1 heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors;
fitted-value and residual analysis;
Rainbow and Breusch-Pagan tests;
Ljung-Box residual-autocorrelation tests;
variance inflation factors;
an AR(3) model for the baseline residuals;
conventional-versus-HC1 standard-error comparison;
joint and individual coefficient tests; and
a partial-regression plot for FEDFUNDS.

Installation
The code requires Python 3.10 or newer and an internet connection for FRED. From the repository root, create a virtual environment and install the pinned dependency ranges:

python -m venv .venv
On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
On macOS or Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Reproduction
Run the full analysis from the repository root:

python replication/run_all.py
The runner executes both workflows in order and verifies that all 14 expected output files were created and are nonempty.

The stages can also be run separately:

python code/macro_regression_workflow.py
python code/diagnostic_workflow.py
Both commands should be launched from the repository root. Generated figures are written to outputs/figures/, tabular results to outputs/tables/, and the two longer diagnostic reports to outputs/diagnostics/.

Output Guide
Location	Contents
outputs/figures/	Time-series, fitted-value, residual, and partial-regression figures
outputs/tables/	Descriptive statistics, correlations, regression output, fitted values, and diagnostic test tables
outputs/diagnostics/	Coefficient-test and residual-autoregression text reports
Interpretation and Limitations
This is a deliberately compact demonstration of a reproducible econometric workflow, not a causal monetary-policy design. The variables enter the baseline model contemporaneously and in levels. The saved diagnostics indicate substantial residual serial correlation and additional specification concerns. HC1 standard errors address heteroskedasticity but do not correct serial correlation.

The coefficient tests should therefore be treated as baseline descriptive results. A substantive empirical extension would examine stationarity, transformations and lags, dynamic specifications, and HAC or other time-series-appropriate inference.

Because FRED observations can be revised and the scripts request the latest available data, future runs may differ slightly from the committed outputs.

Skills Demonstrated
automated public-data acquisition;
data cleaning and validation;
modular Python workflow design;
econometric estimation and inference comparison;
model diagnostics and hypothesis testing;
reproducible output generation; and
transparent documentation of empirical limitations.
